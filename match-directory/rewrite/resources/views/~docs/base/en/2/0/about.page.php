    The HLEB2 framework is the next step in the evolution of the HLEB framework.
</p>
<p>
    The framework was originally designed to become the fastest PHP framework while still providing a robust toolkit for web development.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions about using the framework or believe that a particular topic is not sufficiently covered in the documentation, please reach out to our support chat on Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/phphleb" target="_blank">@phphleb</a>
